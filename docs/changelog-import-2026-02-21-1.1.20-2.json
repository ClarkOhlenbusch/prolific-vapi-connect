      "description": "Researchers can now clear the VAPI evaluation queue from ComputeHub using a new 'Clear queue' button that actually works. Previously the button silently failed because the RLS policy on the queue table had no DELETE permission for users; the fix routes the delete through a new Edge Function that uses the service role key.",
