      "details": "saveVideoUrl called .upsert({run_id, video_url}) without required NOT NULL fields (flow_id, run_created_at). PostgreSQL evaluates NOT NULL before ON CONFLICT so the upsert silently failed even when the row existed. Switched to .update().eq('run_id', ...) and added error throw so failures surface in the UI. Videos uploaded to Storage will now have their URLs saved to the DB."
