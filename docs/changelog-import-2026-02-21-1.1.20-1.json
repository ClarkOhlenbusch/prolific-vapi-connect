      "description": "Researchers now see all pipeline steps (transcription, thematic coding, VAPI evaluation, etc.) as visual nodes with status lights in a dedicated pipeline diagram on the ComputeHub page. Implemented by extracting VAPI eval queue controls from UnifiedParticipantsTable and adding PipelineNode/pipeline diagram components to ComputeHub.tsx.",

      "description": "Thematic coding Pass B (feedback → experiment_responses) now correctly runs on any call that has an experiment_response, not just transcribed calls. Implemented by building a union candidate set of transcribed call IDs and all response call IDs, with Pass A gated on transcription and Pass B gated on response presence.",
